# Tabular_playground_07_2022_clustering

Here is my work for the July clustering competition on kaggle. 

I can't upload the data to github as the file is too big, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jul-2022/data

# About the Tabular Playground Series

Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.

# Welcome to Kaggle's first ever unsupervised clustering challenge!

In this challenge, you are given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster. Your job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to. You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.
